## **FAQ**

### **How can I use it?**

If the specific project has the 🟢 green circle, it means, that it has been released over Maven and a .jar file. When we are uploading all of ours project to Maven, you can use it by click on the right side at the category "Packages". Else you could build it yourself, but I do not recommend it and I will not guide you.

### **When are Upcoming releases**

Its hard to tell, because I am a single developer working on it and I am a student in my most important exam years. Like a proverb in my main language said: ”Besser spät, als nie”
